A New Paradigm for Generative Adversarial Networks based on Randomized Decision Rules
===============

The code includes the experiments of the Empirical Bayesian GAN(EBGAN) by Sehwan Kim, Qifan Song, and Faming Liang. We propose to train the GAN by an empirical Bayes-like method by treating the discriminator as a hyper-parameter of the posterior distribution of the generator. Specifically, we simulate generators from its posterior distribution conditioned on the discriminator using a stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, and update the discriminator using stochastic gradient descent along with simulations of the generators.
